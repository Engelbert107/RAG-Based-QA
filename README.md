# RAG-Based Question Answering from PDF

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that lets users query PDF documents in natural language. Text is extracted and cleaned from PDFs, embedded into a ChromaDB vector store, and combined with a lightweight LLM (TinyLlama) to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
